# Imaginary

## Installation

* fork the project
* change `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` (really?)
* edit `config/initializers/dragonfly.rb`
* deploy to Heroku or any other server
* set up caching ;-)

## Notes

* Served images are not cached by the application, caching is left completely up to you. (I recommend CloudFront.)
